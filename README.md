# UE_Multiplayer-Gamedevtv-SteamOSS
This is an educational project based on the [Gamedev.tv old multiplayer cource](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/) (originally designed for Unreal Engine 4.16+). While the course is outdated today, it provides foundational knowledge of Unreal's Online Subsystem (OSS) and multiplayer principles. This repository represents my early steps in learning UE multiplayer development.

This project covers parts 1â€“3 of a course focused on:

* Replication basics in Unreal Engine.
* Menu system development for lobby joining functionality.
* Steam Online Subsystem (OSS) integration for lobby creation and management.
